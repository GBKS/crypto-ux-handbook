# Crypto UX Handbook

This repository is the place to collaborate on the content of [The Crypto UX Handbook](https://www.cryptouxhandbook.com/).

The goal of the Crypto UX Handbook is to provide an entry point and practical reference for designers working with blockchain and cryptocurrency projects. The technology in this space can be quite complex and it takes time to understand it and be able to design for it. So lets share our findings, help each other do better work, and make our users happy.

## Collaboration

The site and content so far were created by [Christoph Ono](https://github.com/GBKS). Several people have shown interest in contributing and supporting this effort, so this repository was created to facilitate that. As soon as more people contribute, their names will be listed here and on the site. This is an invite to join and help shape this effort.

Github is a great tool for collaboration, but it does require some technical knowledge. So if you would like to contribute, but are not familiar with Github, feel free to each out. Whether it's in a Google Doc or by email, we will find a way for you to participate. 

There are many ways to help out:

- Proof-read and suggest improvements to existing pages
- Share screenshots, screen captures or audits of apps/software
- Write content for completely new pages
- Sponsor the contributors to this project

Big picture, we all want to see world-class UX design in crypto projects. So any way you can help make that happen works.

## Content guidelines

A handbook is meant to be practical for day-to-day use. These guidelines are based on that idea and were used when creating the site:

- Short and precise writing is good (less, but better)
- Use simple language (try [Hemingway](http://www.hemingwayapp.com))
- Less theory, more practical guidance
- Explains things visually when possible (we are designers, after all)
- Show well-executed examples (real-world if possible)

## Working with this repository

You can preview the content of this repository [here](https://gbks.github.io/crypto-ux-handbook/). The content is written in [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), with the addition of a few custom components that require HTML (in the markdown). These components are not well-documented yet, so it's best to refer to the existing markdown files to start. Every page in the handbook has a single markdown file ("content/page-name"), and a dedicated folder for images ("images/page-name"). Images are not 100% well organized at the moment.

Use [Issues](https://github.com/GBKS/crypto-ux-handbook/issues) to discuss the content and request additions and improvements.

Create a [branch](https://github.com/GBKS/crypto-ux-handbook/branches) to actively contribute images and written content. You should be able to clone the repo and run the site locally if you prefer. Once you are happy with it, create a pull request and then your submission will be reviewed and merged into the site.

This is by no means complete and Github has a lot more features to offer. If you can think of a better way to collaborate, bring it up.

...

Peace.
