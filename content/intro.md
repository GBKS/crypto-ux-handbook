# Intro

**Blockchain and cryptocurrencies are new and exciting technologies. But they need to become easier to use and more practical to gain wide adoption.**

Apple, Instagram and many other tech companies have spoiled us with highly polished interfaces for years, so the crypto space feels incredibly raw in comparison. But it only makes sense, since much of the focus is still on maturing the technology and ironing out kinks before unleashing it on the wider population. Soon though, just having the tech will not be enough, marketing and design will play a more important role. And at that point, newcomers need to be able to quickly understand how things work and how to achieve their goals.

Crypto does not only introduce new interaction models, it works on a much broader level. For the first time, we can be in full control over our finances without any (human or institutional) intermediaries. This requires a shift in how we view and use money that can be hard to become comfortable with. But grasping this makes it much easier to use these new systems and also accept new responsibilities, like safeguarding seed phrases for wallets.

There was a time when the Internet was a new and confusing technology, but now it's deeply ingrained in society. Blockchain is still new and confusing, so as designers it's probably a good idea to focus on explaining things well and making things as easy as possible. Only if somebody grasps the basics, can they move on to more complex tasks (like interacting with smart contracts). That's why this site also focuses on the basics of good user experience design. A good foundation is easier to build on top of than a shaky one.

## A new notes

#### This is an evolving document

It does not claim to be complete. If you see something that can be improved or added, and there's probably a lot, [reach out](https://twitter.com/gbks).

#### Screenshots

I use a lot of screenshots from existing software to illustrate ideas, since this many times communicates more clearly than paragraphs of text. In design, there is never just one perfect solution for all users and use cases. So this document is more about illustrating good practices and what to consider during the design process, as well as showcasing good and not-so-good examples. If I used a screenshot of your project and you prefer me to remove it, please [reach out](https://twitter.com/gbks). I try to give credit wherever possible and respect everybody's rights.
