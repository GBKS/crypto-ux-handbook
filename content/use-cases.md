# Use cases

Blockchain technology was specifically designed as the underlying system for the [Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) cryptocurrency. While blockchain can be used to do completely different things, this document focuses on the original intent of storing and transfering value in a decentralized manner.

## Save money

Commonly, bank accounts are where we store the money we save. In parts of the world, where governments and economies are not stable, people cannot rely on the banking system to store not just their money, but the value this money represents. For example, your bank account in Venezuela may quickly lose value due to the extreme inflation. In other countries, governments may confiscate money of people or parts of the population they don't accept. So while Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are highly volatile at the moment, they can nonetheless provide a more stable and safe place to store value. People in developed countries are less likely to have these problems. With wider adoption, the volatility should decrease and the system will become a more reliable store of value.

## Pay for things

While the US Dollar is in a sense the currency of the world, it still is fundamentally controlled by a single country and central bank. The nature of Bitcoin makes it a truly borderless currency that allows for a freer flow of value across the world. With wide adoption, we ideally don't have to pay currency exchanges fees anymore, as well as the sometimes extremely large fees paid for international money transfer. Currently, you might pay $200 to transfer $10,000 to a different country, it could take 3-5 business days, and transfering to some countries might first draw questions from your bank. With crypto, it might cost $0.05, take 10 minutes, and nobody can question you.

## Speculate on prices

Making purchases with cryptocurrencies is still pretty limited. Due to the extreme growth of the sector and the volatility, many traders and investors have started speculating with crypto. Due to the permissionless nature of blockchain, anybody can easily sign up for a crypto exchange and start trading, something that's not so easy with traditional stocks which operate in a much stricter legal environment.

## Loyalty programs
Many larger companies (airlines, grocery stores, coffee shops...) use loyalty programs to keep incentivizing customers to come back. Typically, customers earn points by buying products or taking part in activities like filing out surveys. Those points can then be used to get discounts, free coffee, etc. Putting these programs on the blockchain would move the ownership of those points to users, and would allow for a market to appear on which users could then trade points. Companies might not want this to happen, since it's in their interest for points to not get used. An efficient market would optimize point usage. But there might be new opportunities with blockchain that also lead to benefits for both customers and companies that may evolve.

## Digital assets
[Crypto Kitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/) is the most widely known example of this. Blockchain makes it possible to store and manage ownership of unique, digital assets. Unlike Bitcoin, where each one is like the other, these digital assets are unique. Therefore they are called [non-fungible tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token).

## Manage supply chain information
This idea builds not so much on the aspect of currency, but the idea of having a decentralized, trustedworty database for multiple companies in a business relationship. Typically, each business manages its own data center privately and only makes selective data points available to others. A blockchain would allow for sharing the cost of maintenance and give each party full visibility into data across all operations.

## What else?
If you consider blockchain to be a type of database that works as trusted source of information that many different participants can use, then many big and small use cases can be thought of. So let me know if there's something that should be added her.
