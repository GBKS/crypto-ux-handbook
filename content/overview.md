This is the official design handbook that all [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) and [cryptocurrencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) projects have to follow... just kidding, that wouldn't make any sense. These are the thoughts and notes I gather while doing UX work in the field. There isn't much good information on this available online, so hopefully these notes will help to fill this void a bit.

### What's in here

<toc location="overview" />

This site is a work-in-progress. <a href="mailto:chri@sto.ph">Let me know</a> if you find something incorrect, or would like to see a certain topic added. I'm also always looking for screenshots of various crypto wallets and software. Thanks.

## About

This site was created by [Christoph Ono](http://www.germanysbestkeptsecret.com) as a reference tool for good practices in crypto UX. While helping redesign the [Monero wallet](https://github.com/GBKS/monero-wallet-design) and talking to people in the wider community, I kept hearing that there isn't enough information about designing for crypto online. This is my effort to help address this and hopefully make it easier for others to design better.
